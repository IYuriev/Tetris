# Tetris

To play this Tetris, you should use the keyboard keys to control the pieces. Here's a simple set of instructions:

Move Down: Press the down arrow key to accelerate the descent of the piece.

Move Left/Right: Use the left and right arrow keys to move the piece horizontally to the left or right, respectively.

Rotate Piece: The up arrow key is used to rotate the piece clockwise.

Quick Drop: The spacebar allows you to quickly drop the piece down to the bottom.

The main goal is to form horizontal lines that disappear when they are filled. Players earn points for each cleared line. The game ends when a new piece cannot be placed on the playfield.

Enjoy playing Tetris!
